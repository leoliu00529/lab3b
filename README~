All the files included in the submission (lab3a-605142505.tar.gz) are:

1) lab3a.c
   This is a source file that reads a file system image whose name is specified as a command line
   argument. It analyzes the image and produces report that includes summaries of superblock, group,
   free block entries, free I-node entries, I-node, directory entries, and indirect block references
   to STDOUT. 

2) Makefile
   This contains three targets:
      (default) ... build the lab3a executable.
      clean ... delete all files created by the Makefile.
      dist ... build the distribution tarball.
